		<h3>Unified English Braille</h3><h4>uses the same braille "cells" used represent the letters of several Europe-based languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, etc).</h4>

	<div class="explainer_box">
		<h3>A key difference</h3><h4>is its use of <em>contractions,</em> combinations of braille letters or special characters that make reading and writing braille faster, and fit more content in less space (even contracted braille books are quite large). However, there are many contractions to remember, and they greatly increase the complexity of learning or describing braille in English.</h4>

<!-- braille basics 		<div>
			<h3>Dots</h3><h4>You probably know that braille is a system of raised dots. Braille letters are made up of six of them, arranged 2 tall by 3 wide. This efficient system creates 64 unique character combinations, called braille cells.

	  		When learning braille, students and teachers refer to specific dots positions by numbers. From top to bottom, the left row of dots is numbered 1, 2 and 3. The right row is 4, 5 and 6. So, a letter a is called dot 1, while a letter z is dot 1 3 4 6. </h4>

	  		<h3>Spacing</h3><h4>Letters are spaced slightly from each, aligned uniformly across a page in columns. That negative space is key to touch reading.</h4>
